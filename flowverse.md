Now that you've learned how to program in Cadence and write upgradeable smart contracts, you may be asking yourself:

Now what?

### Enter into the Flowverse

Once you make a project on Flow, you can show it off on [Flowverse](https://www.flowverse.co/).

Think of the Flowverse like a central hub where Flow projects are shown to the public. Everything from individual NFT projects to the overall Flow projects [_rankings_](https://www.flowverse.co/rankings) are put on display for a wider web3 audience to see.

Thus, by using flowverse you can potentially get more eyes on your project.

### Getting your project onto the flowverse

If you want your project to be displayed on the Flowverse website, you must fill this [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7Yfw5\_ugvPKijL1AGjadIUibQuy0TCdlzawcLW2lZPO6G1g/viewform).

### Building on the main network

If you are interested getting your project on Flowverse, LearnWeb3 will be helping students to receive _Flow grants_ which will give you the funds to build your idea on the Flow mainnet.
